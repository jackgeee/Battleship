    Battleship is a turn based two player game.

    <br>
    <br>
    To begin gameplay, initialize the Space Ship positions on the game board and select "get locations". 
    The page will automatically re-direct when the other player has set their positions. 
    Then, click on coordinates on the grid to fire torpedoes. 
    If you hit a ship, you will be alerted and an explosion image will be drawn on your board. If you 
    miss, a "You suck" image will pop up on your grid.
